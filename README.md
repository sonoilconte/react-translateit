The API is at https://frozen-mesa-86739.herokuapp.com

Note: There is not yet full CRUD on the front-end. If a GA instructor would like to test, they can log-in with user: shammer, password: password. Or feel free to create an account to get a user ID, and add data with Postman. I hope to get full CRUD up and running in the near future.

## Description ##

TranslateIt is an app for people all over the world who want to share texts and translations of those texts. The text could be anything, so users are from any background, interest, or profession. Users can see their collection of texts and translations, search for other texts on the site, write new translations of their texts, or translate texts belonging to other users.
 
TranslateIt is not a machine translation service. Instead, the core value of the app is to leverage the linguistic knowledge of humans all over the internet. With upvoting, a consensus can emerge what are the best translations. Effective translation still involves a lot of subtlety, knowledge of idioms, and the ability to read between the lines. TranslateIt is the app where you can tap into those powers to gain and share understanding of all sorts of texts, in many languages.

## Bugs ##

There is currently a bug where the selected translation card sometimes disappears after clicking on a "full text" button. It should reappear if you continue clicking other "full text" links.
